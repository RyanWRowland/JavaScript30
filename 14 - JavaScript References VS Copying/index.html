    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // console.log(team, players);

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    // or Array.from method
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team2[3] = 'Chuck';
    team3[3] = 'Manny';
    team4[3] = 'Zach';
    team5[3] = 'Muriel';
    console.log(players, team2, team3, team4, team5);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 90;
    // console.log(captain, person); // person is modified as well

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 90, age: 23 });
    console.log(captain2, person);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = { ...person };
    cap3.number = 70;
    cap3.age = 21;
    console.log(cap3, person);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
